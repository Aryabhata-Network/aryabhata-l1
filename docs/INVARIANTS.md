# PROTOCOL INVARIANTS

These rules are the supreme laws of the Aryabhata Layer-1. They are immutable and mathematically enforced.

### 1. Supply Invariance
The total supply of units is fixed at 21,000,000,000,000. No inflation or minting is permitted after Genesis.

### 2. Quantum Resistance
All transaction signatures MUST use post-quantum cryptographic schemes (e.g., Dilithium). Non-compliant transactions will be rejected by the consensus.

### 3. Consensus Finality
Once a block reaches ZeroPoW finality, it can never be reorganized or reverted.
