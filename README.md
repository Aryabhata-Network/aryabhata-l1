# ARYABHATA LAYER-1 PROTOCOL

**Status:** Pre-Genesis — Core Frozen

This repository defines the immutable core laws and formal consensus
specification of the Aryabhata Layer-1 protocol.

### Core Principles

- **Quantum-Resistant**  
  The protocol assumes a post-quantum adversary by default.

- **Formal Verification**  
  Consensus rules are defined and validated through formal mathematical proofs.

- **Immutability**  
  No consensus rule, invariant, or cryptographic assumption may change
  after Genesis.
